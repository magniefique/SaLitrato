The primary endeavor of this project is to explore and analyze the following objectives:

\section*{General Objective}
\hspace\parindent
The main purpose of this project is to develop an application software capable of folderwide detecting and locating of a text pattern within multiple image files, enabling users to efficiently find important information present in image(s).

\section*{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop an application integrated with an optical character recognition (OCR) API for extracting texts from images for pattern finding.
    \item To implement the Boyer-Moore algorithm as the string-matching algorithm for the efficient searching of text patterns. 
    \item To implement a function that provides the user with the location of the text pattern in the extracted text of the OCR by means of highlighting the specific location of the text or displaying a prompt if the text pattern is not found.
    \item To test the application software on various image files and text patterns and evaluate its performance in terms of its string-matching algorithm. 
\end{itemize}
