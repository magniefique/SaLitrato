\part{Scope and Limitations}

\hspace\parindent
The coverage of this project is focused on developing a text-searching application made particularly for multiple images, more preferably screenshots and clear scanned documents. The Boyer-Moore algorithm will be the string-matching algorithm used in this project due to its efficiency as stated by recent studies. Moreover, the optical character recognition API used in this project will be a version of Tesseract 4. Lastly, the project will be developed as a desktop application.

\hfill

It is outside the scope of the project to support text searching for other file types such as documents, PowerPoints, PDFs, etc. since the project focuses on image files. In addition to that, the development of an original optical character recognition software for the application is also outside the scope of the project. On top of that, the accuracy of the integrated optical character recognition API will be outside the scope of the project. Furthermore, the project will not provide compatibility with mobile devices.
